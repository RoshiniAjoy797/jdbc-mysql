# JDBC Workflow  

## Steps to Work with JDBC  

1. **Load and Register the Driver**  
   - Load the JDBC driver required for database communication.  

2. **Establish a Connection**  
   - Use the database URL, username, and password to connect.  

3. **Create a Statement**  
   - Prepare a statement object to execute SQL queries.  

4. **Execute the Query**  
   - Run SQL commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.  

5. **Process the Results** (if applicable)  
   - If using `SELECT`, retrieve and handle the data.  

6. **Close the Connection**  
   - Always close the connection to free up resources.
